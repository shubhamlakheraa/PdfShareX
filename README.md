# PdfShareX

PdfShareX is a powerful PDF sharing application that allows users to seamlessly upload, share, and collaborate on PDF documents. With a robust tech stack consisting of Next.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, MongoDB with Mongoose for the database, Cloudinary for cloud storage, and Multer for file handling, PdfShareX provides an efficient and secure platform for managing PDF files.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of PdfShareX follows a modern and scalable design, leveraging the strengths of each technology in the tech stack. Here's an overview of the different components and their interactions:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Built with Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and efficient client-side navigation.
   - Implements responsive and intuitive user interfaces to enhance user experience.
   - Utilizes client-side state management libraries like Redux for managing application state.
   - Interacts with the backend API endpoints for data retrieval and submission.

2. **Backend**:
   - Developed using Node.js with Express, providing a robust and scalable server-side framework.
   - Exposes RESTful API endpoints for handling PDF-related operations such as uploading, downloading, and sharing.
   - Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user-specific features.
   - Interacts with the database and cloud storage service for data persistence and file management.

3. **Database**:
   - Utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL document-oriented database, for storing metadata and related information about PDF documents.
   - Implements data models and schemas using Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
   - Facilitates efficient querying, indexing, and retrieval of PDF document data.

4. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Integrates Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management platform, for storing and managing PDF files.
   - Allows seamless upload and retrieval of PDF documents, with support for metadata and transformations.

5. **File Handling**:
   - Utilizes Multer, a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, for managing file uploads.
   - Performs validation, file size restrictions, and storage configurations for handling PDF uploads.

## Installation

To set up PdfShareX locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shubhamlakheraa/PdfShareX.git`
2. Install dependencies for the frontend: `cd PdfShareX/client && npm install`
3. Install dependencies for the backend: `cd ../server && npm install`
4. Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and set up the required variables (e.g., database connection URL, Cloudinary credentials).
5. Start the development server: In the backend directory, run `npm run dev` to start the backend server. In the frontend directory, run `npm run dev` to start the frontend server.
6. Access PdfShareX in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

PdfShareX combines the power of Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, and Multer to provide a comprehensive PDF sharing solution.
